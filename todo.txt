To do list.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Code:
	- Make graphs framerate independent (x axis should scale with lower frame rates to ensure 60 pixels = 1 second, or similar)
	- Limit distance from Island

	WIP
	- Better third person camera - with its own component controlled movement. Current one is weirdly floaty.
		? Movement based airplane pitch & yaw (aligned to world space movement)
		
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assets:
	- Decals
	- Model and texture Island
	
	- Paint BG textures
		- Horizon
		- New Clouds

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Done!

	Code:
	- Animate control surfaces (rudder, ailerons) procedurally
	- Smooth interpolation for controls
	- Converted Airplane class into a Behavior
	- Loading screen + fade in
	- Limit plane's altitude
	- Scrape assetmanager, load everything in CreateScene function at the right time
	- User-positioned camera
	- Camera reset
	- First person camera
	- Help screen (Escape key or space bar or F1) 
	- Credits screen
	- Message system (a message stack for messages that stay on screen for a few seconds then fade).
	- More predictable (strictly time based, framerate independent) smooth function.
		-Almost working Yay! Still a bit buggy...resets the easeIn attenuation halfway through a movement if keyboard is hit, sometimes...
	- Aspect ratio independent help screen
	
	Assets:
	- Finish texturing airplane
			-Red and white patterns
			-Separate canopi material from body (not necessary)
	- Airplane interior
	
Discarded:

	- Add canvas.Echo() extension
