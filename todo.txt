------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Code:
	- Limit distance from Island
	- Add canvas.Echo() extension
	- Camera reset
	- First person camera
	- Help screen (Escape key or space bar or F1) 
	- Credits screen
	
	WIP
	- User-positioned camera

	- Decals
	- Model and texture Island
	
	- Paint BG textures
