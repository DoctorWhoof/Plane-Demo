To do list.

Code:
	- User-positioned camera
	- Better third person camera - with its own component controlled movement. Current one is weirdly floaty.
	- Limit distance from Island
	- Add canvas.Echo() extension
	- Movement based airplane pitch & yaw (aligned to movement) (?)

Assets:
	-Finish texturing airplane
		-Red and white patterns
		-Decals
		-Separate canopi material from body
	- Airplane interior
		
	-Model and texture Island
	
	-Paint BG textures
		-Horizon
		-New Clouds
	
Done!

Code:
	- Animate control surfaces (rudder, ailerons) procedurally
	- Smooth interpolation for controls
	- Converted Airplane class into a Behavior
	- Loading screen + fade in
	- Limit plane's altitude
	-Scrape assetmanager, load everything in CreateScene function at the right time
