To do list.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Code:
	- Message system (a message stack for messages that stay on screen for a few seconds then fade).
	- Limit distance from Island
	- Add canvas.Echo() extension

	WIP
	- Better third person camera - with its own component controlled movement. Current one is weirdly floaty.
		- Movement based airplane pitch & yaw (aligned to movement) (?)
		
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assets:
	- Decals
	- Model and texture Island
	
	- Paint BG textures
		- Horizon
		- New Clouds
